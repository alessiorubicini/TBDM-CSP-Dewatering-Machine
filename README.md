# TBDM CSP Dewatering Machine

The project revolves around analyzing and optimizing data from a dewatering machine used in the sludge dewatering process, which is considered as a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). By leveraging Big Data technologies, specifically InfluxDB and Grafana, the project aims to study, visualize, and derive insights from sensor data provided in the form of multiple datasets. These datasets include parameters such as polyelectrolyte concentration, differential speeds, mud flow rates, machine status, and more.

### Objectives

The objective is to study the tool, what features it offers, data map visualization, monitoring and alarm dashboards, AI tool integration. In particular, investigate influx V3 with comparison to the V2 version (performance, flux/sql hook language), integration API in real operational contexts (use of C#, Java, RESTAPI), limitations encountered.
